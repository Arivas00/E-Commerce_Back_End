## Description

E-Commerce Back End is a server side application that utilizes Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database for a internet retail company. The application creates a database based off four models and fills in the the information into the database based off the seed data. The data for each API GET route is deplayed in a formatted JSOn when using Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags. When testing API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core it will successfully create, update and delete data in the database.
